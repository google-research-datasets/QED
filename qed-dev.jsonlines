The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year .

In the late industrial revolution , progressive American legal scholars began to use the term more , particularly Louis Brandeis and Roscoe Pound .

Upperclassmen are intimidating and will steal any lunch money along with loose change if you stand in the wrong place . Scott gets put in advanced classes , including an Honors English class which , despite the amount of homework , is his favorite class . His teacher , Mr. Franka , becomes a mentor to him . Scott finds out that he 's not in classes with his friends since he 's carrying all honors and college prep classes . He tries his best from the very start to get the attention of Julia Baskins , a girl who was in his kindergarten class and has recently become very beautiful over the summer . Because of her beauty she quickly blends in with the popular girls and is attracted to the football players who are often bullying Scott . Scott is also connected to another classmate named Louden , who is better known as Mouth . Scott tries every attempt to get Julia 's attention such as joining the school paper , because he thinks that she is part of the staff , only to discover that she has written only a single column for the paper . He then runs for student council , after finding out that Julia is also running as well , and wins a seat , only to find out that she has not won . Because of this , Scott resigns from his position on the student council . It turns out that a lot of other members also resigned including the president meaning Julia who happened to have the 2nd most amount of votes is now president . He also auditions for the school play and is selected as a member of the crew , thinking that Julia is also auditioning for the play . However , Julia has not been selected as a member of the cast or crew . Soon , a new girl named Lee arrives at school , who wears face pins and weird clothes , and has wildly colored hair . Both soon realize that they share the same interests , but he ca n't get past his crush on Julia . Scott suddenly has another `` friend '' named Wesley , a high school senior . Though they share some interests , they have little in common . Then to put the cherry on top of all this excitement going on in his life , his mother announces that she is pregnant . He copes with all of this by creating a tip book for his soon - to - be baby sibling to help him , or her , survive high school when they get to it . In his entries to the baby , he often shows disdain by using degrading terms to talk to it such as `` Smelly '' or `` Blob of unformed goo '' . But he writes it to be a good older brother to this new baby since Scott 's own brother was never very present . As time goes by , Scott tries to find his place , but he starts to lose his best friends . Mitch finds a girlfriend and soon forgets the group , Patrick moves to Texas , then to Japan , and Kyle joins the wrestling team and soon puts Scott down for having a crush on Julia . Soon , Julia 's boyfriend Vernon beats up Scott after finding out from Kyle ( who lost a fight with Scott ) that Scott has a crush on his girlfriend . Scott realizes that what a person says and does can affect the life of another after Mouth attempts to commit suicide . Later , he learns that not everything is what it seems once he finds out that his older brother , Bobby , who is struggling to find a job , can barely read . Scott 's mother eventually gives birth to a new baby boy , whom they name Sean . Meanwhile , Bobby finds a job through guitar - playing and Julia eventually starts dating a nicer guy , though she is now close to Scott enough to give him a kiss on the cheek .", "sentence_starts": [0, 186, 306, 442, 495, 613, 789, 928, 1019, 1231, 1379, 1454, 1616, 1751, 1823, 1941, 2040, 2118, 2182, 2302, 2452, 2596, 2709, 2800, 2984, 3135, 3255, 3413, 3494], "original_nq_answers": [[{"start": 20, "end": 36, "string": "J.P.

By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended . The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked . In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' . Today , kudzu is estimated to cover 3,000,000 hectares ( 7,400,000 acres ) of land in the southeastern United States , mostly in Alabama , Georgia , Tennessee , Florida , North Carolina , South Carolina and Mississippi .

Daenerys Targaryen is the exiled princess of the Targaryen dynasty . Also called `` the Stormborn '' , she and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert 's Rebellion . For seventeen years , she has been under the care of Viserys , whom she fears , as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him . In exchange for an army , Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo , making her a Khaleesi , a queen of the Dothraki . Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language , she manages to get past their barriers . She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man . After embracing the Dothraki culture , she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother . She later becomes pregnant with Drogo 's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' . After her brother 's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon , Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son . However , during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman . Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic . Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son 's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo , leaving him in a permanent catatonic state , and forcing Daenerys to end her husband 's life . Losing both her husband and son , Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake . She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo 's body , then steps into the burning funeral pyre . After the fire extinguishes itself , the Khaleesi and three baby dragons , named Drogon , Rhaegal , and Viserion , are found alive and unharmed . Daenerys takes the baby dragons and the remaining tribe to gather new allies and reclaim the Iron Throne . She becomes the first female Dothraki leader . In Season 2 , she is lost in the Red Waste , a stretch of barren land . She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth , where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquering Westeros . When her dragons are stolen by Pyat Pree , she goes into the House of the Undying and retrieves them , killing Pyat Pree . In the second season 's finale , she imprisons her host Xaro Xoan Daxos for having helped Pyat Pree . Her horde loot Xaro 's mansion to buy a ship . Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor , a city in Slaver 's Bay , where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied . She also meets the famed knight Ser Barristan Selmy , and accepts him into her queensguard . On her departure from the city , she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders . By the end of Season 3 , although her power has not yet been tested , she has acquired the loyalty of tens of thousands of freed slaves from Astapor and Yunkai , her remaining Dothraki brethren ( and two former Westerosi soldiers whom she encountered through the Dothraki , who advise her ) 2,000 ' Second Sons ' cavalrymen , 8,000 ' Unsullied ' elite infantry , and three rapidly growing dragons . The stay in Slaver 's Bay has made her question her motives , however , and she takes up the cause of ending slavery as well , donning the honorific `` Breaker of Chains '' as the slaves hold her to the sky , praising her as their Mhysa , or `` Mother '' . Daenerys later frees the slaves from Meereen , the last of the slave cities in Slaver 's Bay , but realizes that she is slowly losing control of her dragons , especially when Drogon shows signs of aggression towards her when she tries to break up a fight between them over food . Aware that she does not have enough men to conquer Westeros just yet , Daenerys resolves to remain in Slaver 's Bay and rule as Queen for the time being . She eventually learns of Jorah 's original purpose , which was to spy on her for Robert Baratheon , and orders him to leave Meereen on threat of execution . After she receives too many complaints about her dragons , Daenerys , locks Rhaegal and Viserion of them in the catacombs beneath Meereen before searching for Drogon . Meanwhile , Daenerys faces a new threat to her rule in the form of the Sons of the Harpy , a resistance movement against her and the Unsullied . She considers freeing her dragons , but they attempt to attack her , making her realize that they are no longer loyal to her . After Daario and Grey Worm arrest a member of the Sons of the Harpy , Mossador implores Daenerys to execute their captive , but Barristan tells her of the Mad King 's actions against his enemies , which included burning them with wildfire while laughing . He asks her not to execute the captive without a fair trial , and she agrees with him . Mossador goes against her wishes , and kills the captive Son of the Harpy . Daenerys has him publicly executed , which leads a riot to break out between the old masters and the freed slaves . At night , Daenerys finds that Drogon has returned , but when she tries to touch his face , he flies away . Soon afterward , a group of Unsullied patrolling the streets of Meereen are stopped by a crying woman who points them to an alleyway . The Unsullied head in to investigate , but it is revealed that the entire affair was a set up after they are soon cornered by a group of the Sons of the Harpy . The Unsullied attempt to fight back , but the Sons of the Harpy kill many of them . Barristan Selmy sees the commotion and tries to help , killing many of the Sons of the Harpy , but gets badly wounded , and dies . Grey Worm also sustains serious but nonfatal injuries . Daenerys is furious after learning what has happened to Barristan , and rounds up the leaders of the great Meereenese houses . She takes them into the catacombs where she randomly has one of them shoved forward . The Meereenese lord is promptly killed by dragonfire from Rhaegal , and he and Viserion eat him . Daenerys then has all the lords arrested , including her former adviser Hizdahr zo Loraq , whom she decides to marry to win over the Meereenese nobles . To respect the culture of the region , she agrees to have the fighting pits reinstated ( she had previously declined due to her distaste for killing for sport ) . Hizdahr convinces Daenerys to go to one of the pits to see the contestants battling over who will go to the final competition . Daenerys is sickened by the bloodshed , and gets up to leave , but her attention is turned by one masked competitor who defeats all of the other competitors without killing any of them . This competitor turns out to be Jorah Mormont , who is trying to win over Daenerys ' favor after being banished . Daenerys orders the Unsullied to take him away , but Jorah announces that he has brought her a gift , and Tyrion Lannister reveals himself to Daenerys . After a round of questioning , Daenerys banishes Jorah once again , but takes Tyrion on as her adviser . On the great opening of Daznak 's Pit , Jorah resurfaces as a voluntary contender on the arena , but Daenerys refuses to stop the games to spare his life . Jorah eventually prevails and saves her life by impaling with his spear an attacker from the Sons of the Harpy , who appear in legions and attack Daenerys ' guards . Cornered at the midst of the arena , defeat seems immediate when Drogon returns , killing many Sons of the Harpy despite being wounded by several of their spears . Daenerys manages to rekindle their bond and climbs his back , riding off into the distance to a stunned crowd . She roams the Great Steppe north of the city , where Drogon seems reluctant to obey her commands or even hunt for food . Strolling about on her own , Daenerys is faced with an incoming Dothraki khalasar of great numbers , and after dropping a ring to the ground to leave a trail , she is surrounded . In season 6 , the Dothraki take her to Vaes Dothrak , where she identifies herself to Khal Moro as Drogo 's former wife . Out of respect for Dothraki traditions , they take Daenerys to join the Dosh Khaleen , which consisted of the wives of deceased khals . Daenerys refuses and instead burns the temple down with herself and all the khals still inside . She emerges unscathed , and the awed Dothraki accept her as their new leader . She returns to Meereen with her new army and destroys the slaver fleet assaulting the city with her dragons . In the aftermath , Daenerys meets with Theon and Yara Greyjoy , who offer their support for her claim so that they can overthrow their uncle Euron . Daenerys accepts their aid and secures help from the Reach and Dorne , names Tyrion as her hand , but breaks up with Daario , ordering him to stay behind and govern Slaver 's Bay in her absence . With her new army , Daenerys finally sets sail for Westeros . In Season 7 Daenerys finally uses her dragons in battle , annihilating a Lannister force and their baggage train with fire . Daenerys welcomes Jon Snow to Dragonstone , seeing him as a friend and ally , insisting that he bend the knee to her but exhibiting patience with his refusal . She believes his tales of white walkers and agrees to let him mine dragonglass ( obsidian ) from her land . When Jon 's expedition north of the Wall gets into trouble Daenerys takes her dragons to rescue them , and is devastated when the Night King kills one . On the ship back to Dragonstone she and Jon make love .", "sentence_starts": [0, 72, 141, 266, 400, 542, 673, 802, 895, 1022, 1194, 1337, 1435, 1615, 1708, 1844, 1990, 2097, 2144, 2216, 2350, 2473, 2575, 2622, 2771, 2864, 2952, 3351, 3608, 3888, 4043, 4200, 4368, 4513, 4640, 4896, 4984, 5060, 5176, 5284, 5419, 5580, 5664, 5795, 5851, 5978, 6064, 6162, 6315, 6478, 6606, 6793, 6907, 7060, 7165, 7321, 7487, 7651, 7763, 7884, 8064, 8186, 8322, 8419, 8498, 8608, 8757, 8953, 9015, 9140, 9300, 9408, 9561], "original_nq_answers": [[{"start": 56, "end": 69, "string": "Emilia Clarke"}]], "annotation": {"referential_equalities": [{"question_reference": {"start": 10, "end": 47, "string": "the dragon queen from game of thrones"}, "sentence_reference": {"start": 0, "end": 42, "bridge": false, "string": "Daenerys Targaryen ( season 1 -- present )"}}], "answer": [{"sentence_reference": {"start": 56, "end": 69, "bridge": false, "string": "Emilia Clarke"}, "paragraph_reference": {"start": 56, "end": 69, "string": "Emilia Clarke"}}], "explanation_type": "single_sentence", "selected_sentence": {"start": 0, "end": 72, "string": "Daenerys Targaryen ( season 1 -- present ) portrayed by Emilia Clarke .

As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools , the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company .

These differences were a result of wear on the machines and since each new weapon caused a tiny amount of wear , each barrel would be slightly different from every other barrel produced by that company .
